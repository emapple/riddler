This week, the Riddler Classic asks us about dice. If we roll a 6-sided die 6 times, and label a new die with the 6 numbers that come up, and then repeat this process with the new die, what is the average number of iterations before our new die has only 1 number on all 6 sides?

My first approach is brute-force computational.
