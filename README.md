Attempts or solutions for FiveThirtyEight's riddler questions

Every week, FiveThirtyEight offers [The Riddler and Riddler Express](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/), which are logic or math problems offered for fun. This repository contains my solutions (or attempts therein) to some of them.

Each directory contains a week, with some description of the problem and my solution(s). If you feel I have made a mistake, please let me know!
