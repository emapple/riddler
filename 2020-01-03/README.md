This week, the Riddler Classic asks us to follow the rules of the NYTimes' Spelling Bee game to determine which combination of 7 unique letters will lead to the highest scoring game. The approach used here is a brute-force approach, and more elegant solutions may exist. Since this approach is fairly computationally intensive, I have also coded it in C++, where it runs about 10 times faster.
