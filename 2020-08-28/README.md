This week's Riddler Express is a simple problem: if the world were covered by a sheet, how much area would you have to add in order to have the sheet raised 1 meter above the ground?

This is a slightly different take on the more common problem of a rope around the Earth, and how much length you have to add to raise it by 1 meter. Both cases are quite simple. In each case, you can simply find the difference between the area/circumference with a radius of $r+1$ and a radius of $r$.

For the rope:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r_1%20-%20r_0%20%3D%202%5Cpi%5C%2C%28r&plus;1%29%20-%202%5Cpi%5C%2Cr%20%3D%202%5Cpi%20%5Capprox%206.28%5C%2C%20m)

For the sheet:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_1%20-%20A_0%20%3D%204%5Cpi%5C%2C%28r&plus;1%29%5E2%20-%204%5Cpi%5C%2Cr%5E2%20%3D%208%5Cpi%5C%2Cr%20&plus;%204%5Cpi%20%5Capprox%201.60%5Ctimes10%5E8%5C%2C%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D%5E2)

The difference in area happens to be almost exactly the same as the area of Liechtenstein, according to Wikipedia.

For the Riddler Classic, we are asked how many games of War you expect to play before you encounter a game that is finished in exactly 26 turns/draws. Please refer to the notebook for a both an analytic derivation of the solution (about 162 million games!), and for a computational confirmation of our analytic derivation.
